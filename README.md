World IPv6 Launch Day was June 6th, 2012; because of its extremely slow adoption, the IPv4 pool was exhausted in November 2019. Amazon Web Services (AWS) started billing for IPv4 addresses on February 1st, 2024, which helped push adoption since IPv6 is still **free** for Internet connectivity.

A few Open-Source Intelligence Threat (OSINT) feeds have included IPv6 atomic indicators. Unfortunately, the required effort to sustain threat feeds has led to lost project maintainers or seen them migrate behind a wall.

I wish I had more IPv6 indicators since I finally bit the bullet with my networks.

Feedwalla provides a Threat Feed focusing on Internet Scanners using Firewalla data targeting North Dakota, including blocked IPv6 connections.
